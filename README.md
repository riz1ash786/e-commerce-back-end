## Description

I have been tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Iâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

Start with cloning this repository link on to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/riz1ash786/e-commerce-back-end
$ cd e-commerce-back-end
```

To install the required dependencies and set up the application, run:

```
$ npm i
```

You will also need to place a .env file in the root directory of the project, in order to connect to your MySQL database. Here's a specific example:

file: .env

```
DB_USER=root
DB_PW=
DB_NAME=ecommerce_db
```

## Usage

- To connect to the database run` mysql -u root -p`
- Then source the 'schema.sql'
- To seed the file run `npm run seed`
- Finally, to connect to the server run `npm start`
